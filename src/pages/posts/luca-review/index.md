Luca is a heartwarming film about innocence, discovery, and friendship. At its core is a lighthearted simple story, which—in today's world of subtleties, nuances, and grey areas—is surprisingly refreshing. The setting exhibits a quiet beauty, from the dreamy under-waterscapes to the idyllic Italian countryside. The stylized characters feel fresh and are absolutely adorable; Luca is absolutely adorable—this is probably the "cutest" film Pixar has ever put out. Finally and most importantly, the movie is brimming with heart. This is probably my favorite Pixar film in a while, and I definitely will have to watch it again.
