What a wonderful little [game](http://www.loversinadangerousspacetime.com/)! One-of-a-kind game design, clever levels, fun music, and adorable trippy art that reminds you of Powerpuff Girls!

It was the best use of the co-op format that I've ever seen. You _really_ had to work together as a _team_ to succeed. Played this with my girlfriend and her brother and we had an absolute blast! Never had more fun playing a co-op game (and I grew up playing co-op games.) Highly recommended. Out on Nintendo Switch now. Grab a buddy or two and get this game. No wonder it's a solid 10/10 on Steam!
